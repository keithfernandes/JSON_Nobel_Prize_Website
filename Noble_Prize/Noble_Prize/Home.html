        <h3>Nobel Prize?</h3>
        <p>
            The Nobel Prizes are prizes awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,
            the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institutet, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to
            individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry,
            physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. They were established
            by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered
            by the Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968
            by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributions to the field of economics.
            Each recipient, or "laureate", receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money,
            which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation.
